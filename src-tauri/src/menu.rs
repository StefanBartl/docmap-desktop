//! The window's menu bar.
//!
//! **Structure here, strings in the frontend.** Which items exist, what order
//! they sit in, which are platform-predefined and what each is bound to are
//! facts about this application and belong in one place. The *labels* are
//! translations, and translations already live in `src/lib/i18n.js` with a
//! spec that fails when a locale is missing a key or carries one the source
//! no longer has. A second catalog in Rust would be two files with one
//! meaning, and `docs/MENUBAR.md` names that as the wrong answer before it
//! was written — the same drift that cost `to_json` and the page payload six
//! fields between them.
//!
//! So the frontend builds the menu: it calls `set_menu` with a label per id
//! after i18n has initialised, and again whenever the language, the theme,
//! the zoom or the selection changes. Missing keys are an error naming them
//! rather than a silent fallback, because the catalog test guarantees they
//! cannot be missing and a quiet English label in a German menu is exactly
//! the failure that test exists to prevent.
//!
//! Clicking an item emits `menu` to the webview with the item's id. The
//! handlers stay in `main.js` beside the buttons that already call them —
//! one implementation, two ways to reach it, rather than a second copy
//! behind the menu.
