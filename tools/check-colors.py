"""Fail when a colour is written in the stylesheets of src/ outside the tokens of appkit-ui.

The rules are appkit's own: tools/check-color-literals.py is its file, kept verbatim (from appkit b8c24c5, the same
copy as in tasks-desktop and rules-desktop) so a newer one replaces it without a merge. That file lets one token
file hold colours; this window has two, the copy of the kit's tokens and the plain-colour fallback generated from
it, and tools/check-appkit-tokens.py checks both against the kit. Every other tracked .css file under src/ is read
with the kit's rules.

Exit 0: clean. Exit 1: the places are listed (file, line, literal). Exit 2: git could not be asked, or no file was
read.
