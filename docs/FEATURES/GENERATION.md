# Generation

Running the engine. This app does not analyse anything — it finds
`documentation.nvim`'s standalone binary, runs it as a subprocess, and shows
what came back: its own lines as they are, its findings grouped per check.

## Four generate commands, four guarantees

Not four speeds of one thing. What separates them is what they run on and
whether they overwrite:

| Command | Runs on | Overwrites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-generate on add | the project just added | never — only when there is no map yet |
| Project → Generate map | the selected project | that one |
| Project → Regenerate and reload | the selected project | that one, and reloads the view |
| Project → Generate all | every project in the workspace | all of them |
| Project → Generate the out-of-date ones | every project whose sources moved on | those |

**Generate all** is a menu item rather than a sidebar button on purpose: the
sidebar keeps exactly one command, and this is the one place the app writes
to disk without being asked about a specific project.

- **Module:** `src/main.js`, `src/lib/busy-button.js`
- **Usercmds:** `Ctrl+G`, `F5`, `Ctrl+Shift+G`, and Project → Generate the out-of-date ones
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#generate-generate-all-generate-the-out-of-date-ones)

## Batch runs are sequential, and counted

**Generate all** runs projects one after another, not in parallel: each run
is its own CPU-bound process, and starting a dozen at once would not finish
sooner, only make the machine harder to use while it happened.

Progress is counted in the status bar (`Generating 3/12…`) for exactly that
reason — a multi-minute run with no visible progress looks identical to a
hang. One project failing does not stop the rest; the status line names every
failure once the batch finishes.

- **Module:** `src/main.js`

## Generate the out-of-date ones measures, it does not read the cache

It compares modification times per project rather than consulting the
freshness cache, because the cache only holds projects that have been
opened — acting on it would skip exactly the ones this command exists for.

- **Module:** `src-tauri/src/freshness.rs`, `src/lib/status-cache.js`
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#generate-generate-all-generate-the-out-of-date-ones)

## The staleness mark

The selected project carries a mark when its sources moved on since its map
was built. Shown for the selected project rather than as a count on the
picker: a number behind a click is a number nobody reads.

It is a comparison of modification times, not a re-analysis — it answers
"something changed since this was written", not "the map would come out
different".

- **Module:** `src-tauri/src/freshness.rs`
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#the-staleness-mark)

## Generate map (full)

Adds `lua-language-server`'s type detail — the `@class`/`@alias` information
behind the Types panel. It needs `lua-language-server` on `PATH`; without it
the run fails and says exactly that, and the ordinary Generate still produces
a complete map apart from that detail.

- **Usercmds:** Project → Generate map (full)
- **Dependency:** `lua-language-server` on `PATH`, for this command only

## Finding the engine — three sources, in one order

The panel at the bottom of the sidebar answers one question — can this app
generate anything right now — and says so in one word beside the header even
while collapsed: `ready`, `no grammars`, or `not found`.

Three places the engine can come from, in order: **a path you set** (an act
of intent, so it wins), **the copy installed beside this app** (Windows and
Linux; the exact build this version was tested against), then **an engine on
`PATH`**.

**The bundled one beats `PATH`, and that order changed after it bit.** `PATH`
used to win. Measured right after v0.2.0: the app was using a `docmap.exe`
from two days earlier — four languages, an older schema — while its own
installed copy read twenty-three, and nothing said so. A binary on `PATH` is
somebody's leftover as often as it is their intention, and this program
cannot tell the two apart.

A configured path that stops existing is not remembered as broken: the app
falls back through the list rather than failing later with a raw OS error.

- **Module:** `src-tauri/src/deps.rs`, `src/lib/deps.js`
- **Config:** Settings → Engine
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#the-engine-indicator)

## The engine contract — `engine.lock`

The engine is a rolling release with no version number, so what this app
pins is the contract, not the binary: one commit of documentation.nvim, the
artifact schema it writes and the `/api/*` routes it answers, the same shape
`engine.lock` has in tasks-desktop and rules-desktop. `contract/docmap.schema.json`
is that commit's `.docmap.json` schema, byte for byte.

**Held in three places.** CI checks the engine source at the pinned commit
and the binary of the rolling release against the lock, so a schema bump in
the engine turns this repository red until the lock moves. The lock is
compiled into the app, and the engine panel's **Contract** row compares it
with what the engine on this machine answers: a binary on `PATH`, one chosen
by hand, or a bundled one older than the lock.

**Newer is not "fine".** The schema is compared for equality, the routes as a
lower bound: an engine with one more route serves this window exactly as
well, while a schema bump may remove a field the window reads.

- **Module:** `src-tauri/src/contract.rs`, `src/lib/contract.js`, `tools/check-engine-lock.py`
- **Config:** `engine.lock` — moved with `python tools/check-engine-lock.py --write --commit <sha>`
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#the-engine-indicator)

## Tree-sitter grammars, and why there is no download button

Pointing at a directory of compiled grammars is optional. Without one,
generation still succeeds — a complete module tree, correctly. With one, the
same run also gets function-level detail: signatures, call graphs,
parameters. `no grammars` reports that difference; it is not a problem to
fix.

**When one is missing, the panel says where it looked** — it names the
directory the engine is given, lists what that directory actually holds, and
gives the file name a missing grammar would have (`zig.dll`, `.so`,
`.dylib`). It lists contents rather than computing which paths the engine
would probe: the resolution order belongs to the engine, and a second copy of
that rule here could disagree with it while looking authoritative.

**There is no download button, and that is a decision.** Fetching grammars
would mean pulling native shared libraries from a rolling release tag with no
published checksum and handing them to a program that `dlopen`s them — fine
in CI, a silent update channel for unverified executable code in an installed
app. Naming the missing file costs nothing and touches no network.

**Not every language needs one.** The engine reads assembly without a grammar
at all, because GAS, NASM and ARM are a fork rather than dialects and a line
scanner is the right instrument across all three. The panel keeps "needs no
parser" and "wanted a parser and could not find it" apart, so a backend at
full fidelity is never reported as broken.

- **Config:** Settings → Engine → Grammars…
- **Docs:** [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md#the-engine-indicator)

## The engine's report

Counts and coverage are shown as the engine wrote them. The findings, which
can be a hundred lines for a large vault, are grouped by check with a few
examples each and a **Show all** button (it counts the findings the report lists:
the tally above also counts `info` findings, which the engine never lists); the
status bar names the error and warning counts, in the interface language and
singular for one (`1 error`); a clean run reads `Generated X` (`X erzeugt`).

Where it is shown depends on whether there is a map to show:

- **A run that wrote its map** puts the report in a panel at the foot of the
  map (**Engine report**), with its own scroll bar and a close button. It is
  docked, not laid over the map: the map gets shorter by the height of the
  panel, and the Files and Statistics views share the space above it the same
  way, so nothing covers the report and the report covers nothing. Another
  project, another message, the close button or **Esc** inside the panel takes
  it away; closing it hands the keyboard focus to **Generate** (or the project
  picker while Generate is busy). **Show all** stays at the foot of the panel
  while it scrolls.
- **A run that failed**, and **Check exactly**, have no map, so the report sits
  under the message in the middle of the view, which scrolls when the report is
  longer than the window and can be reached with Tab when it has no button.

Changing the interface language with a report open words it again: the **Show
all** button, the "and N more" rows and the status line (the choice of folded or
expanded stays).

Findings never make a run "Failed" — the engine is asked for `--lenient`, so
findings in the tree do not turn into a non-zero exit. It stays non-zero for a
run that could not do its job (no such directory, a refused output directory, a
crashed backend). It can also be non-zero with the map already on disk: the
engine computes coverage and the summary after it has written the map, so a
crash in that later part still exits 1 (read from the engine's source, not
provoked), and the window then shows the run as failed.

- **Module:** `src/main.js`, `src/lib/engine-log.js` (the grouping), `src/lib/log-view.js` (drawing it; `src-tauri/src/main.rs` `generate_command` passes `--lenient`)
- **Tests:** `src/lib/log-view.test.js`, `src/lib/wiring.test.js`; the layout itself is measured in the browser preview with `tools/preview/probe-report.js`
