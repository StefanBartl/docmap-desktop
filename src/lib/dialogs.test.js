// the window's minimum height (600, `tauri.conf.json`), so they scroll.
// Measured in a browser at 900x600 before the rule below existed: the
// project-settings dialog wanted 715px, got 564, and put **Save** 149px
// under the fold — reachable only by scrolling a box whose most obvious
// wheel targets (the language grid, the exclude textarea) scroll something
// else. This is what the tests could not see and a window could.
//
// Asserted from the sources rather than from a rendered page, like the
// other tests here: what has to hold is that every dialog's last-word
// button is *covered by the rule*, and both halves of that live in text.
